The practice was so common that it gained the pejorative moniker “Dr. Google.” But times are changing, and many medical-information seekers are now using LLMs. Acco...",
          "simplifiedContent": "**Title: Can ChatGPT Health Help Us Better Than \"Dr. Google\"?**\n\nFor years, when people felt sick or had new symptoms, they often turned to the internet to figure out what might be wrong. This habit became so common that people started calling it \"Dr. Google.\" However, things are starting to change. \n\nNowadays, instead of just searching online, many people are using something called ChatGPT Health. This is a tool powered by artificial intelligence (AI), which is a kind of smart computer program that can understand and respond to questions in a human-like way.\n\nChatGPT Health works by using a large language model (LLM), which means it can read and process a lot of information quickly to give helpful answers about health. Some people believe this tool could offer more accurate and understandable information than a regular internet search.\n\nThis could be good news for anyone looking for medical advice online, as it might help us make better sense of our symptoms and what to do next. However, it's important to remember that while these tools can be helpful, they are not a replacement for seeing a real doctor.",

          "simplifiedContent": "**Title: New Cloud Company Raises $100 Million to Compete with Amazon**\n\nRailway, a tech company from San Francisco, just got a big boost. They raised $100 million to help them grow and compete with giants like Amazon in the cloud business. The cloud is like a giant online storage space where companies can keep their data and run applications (programs or apps).\n\nWhat's impressive is that Railway attracted two million developers—people who create software—without spending any money on advertising. Developers like Railway because it helps them build and run AI applications (smart computer programs) more easily.\n\nAs more people want to use AI, older cloud services are struggling to keep up. Railway's new funding will help them create better tools for these smart applications, making it easier for developers to work with AI.\n\nFor everyday people, this means that the apps and services you use could become smarter and more efficient, thanks to companies like Railway making it easier for developers to innovate.",

He’s won major awards for his work and is known for having bold opinions. Right now, many people in tech are excited about large language models. These are computer programs that can understand and create human-like text. But LeCun thinks everyone is too focused on them.\n\nHe believes these models won’t solve many important problems we face. Instead, LeCun is interested in exploring new ideas and different approaches in AI. He wants to find better ways for computers to learn and think.\n\nFor regular folks, this means that while big companies are putting their efforts into making machines that can chat like people, LeCun is looking for other ways to improve AI. His work could lead to new technologies that might be more useful in our daily lives.\n\nIn simple terms, while everyone else is following the crowd, LeCun is taking a different road. This could lead to exciting new discoveries in how we use AI in the future.",

This decision comes after a flood of reports from AI tools. These AI tools, which are computer programs designed to find problems, have been pointing out issues that aren’t real or useful.\n\nThe problem started when some AI programs began identifying fake problems in cURL’s code. This caused a lot of unnecessary work for the team because they had to spend time checking these fake problems. It was becoming too much to handle and was affecting the team’s well-being.\n\nBy stopping the bug reward program, cURL hopes to reduce the stress on its team and keep their focus on real issues. They want to make sure their team stays healthy and happy while they continue to improve the tool.\n\nFor everyday people, this means cURL is trying to work smarter, not harder, by avoiding distractions caused by false alarms from AI.

They want to stop certain computer programs, called \"shopping bots,\" from using the site without permission. These bots can automatically search for and buy items for people, which sounds helpful, but there are problems.\n\nRecently, more people have been using these bots to quickly buy up popular items, like limited edition sneakers or concert tickets. This can make it hard for regular people to get these items because the bots are so fast. eBay's new rule means these bots need to get approval before they can shop on the site.\n\nThis change is important because it aims to make shopping on eBay fairer for everyone. When bots buy up all the good stuff, it leaves fewer options for real people who just want to shop normally. By controlling these bots, eBay hopes to create a better shopping experience for all its users.",
