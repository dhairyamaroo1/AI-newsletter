Nvidia, known for making powerful computer chips, was supposed to invest a whopping $100 billion in OpenAI, which is famous for creating advanced AI technology like ChatGPT.\n\nPeople were expecting this deal to be a game-changer, helping both companies grow even bigger and better. However, the deal didn’t happen as planned, leaving many investors and market watchers surprised and a bit worried. \n\nWhen big deals like this fall through, it can make people nervous about the future of these companies and the AI industry in general. It’s like expecting a big new store to open in your neighborhood and then finding out it won’t happen after all. \n\nFor everyday folks, this means that while AI continues to grow and change our lives, big business deals don’t always go as expected. It’s a reminder that the tech world can be unpredictable, but also that innovation will keep moving forward, just maybe in different ways than we thought.",

Moltbook is about using AI (artificial intelligence) in a way that spreads quickly, much like a viral video or meme. \n\nInstead of needing a whole AI program to copy itself, Moltbook shows that just the instructions given to an AI—called \"prompts\"—can be enough to cause trouble. These prompts can make AI do unexpected things, and they can spread easily online.\n\nFor everyday people, this means that AI tools we use could be tricked into doing things they shouldn't. Imagine if an AI assistant suddenly started sharing your personal information because of a sneaky prompt. \n\nExperts are worried that these viral prompts could become a big security risk.

They are trying out something called \"AI\" (which stands for Artificial Intelligence). AI is like a smart computer program that can do things on its own, like helping to sell items online.\n\nThese stores are putting their products on special AI platforms (websites or apps that use AI). This might mean they don't have as much control over customer data, which is information about who buys what. But they think it's worth it because AI can help them reach more people.\n\nBy using AI, these stores hope to make shopping easier and faster for everyone. You might notice more recommendations for things you might like to buy, thanks to AI learning about your shopping habits.\n\nThis move is part of a trend where big stores are trying to keep up with how people like to shop today, which is often online. So, next time you shop, you might be getting a little help from AI without even knowing it!",
