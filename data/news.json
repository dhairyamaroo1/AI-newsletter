The practice was so common that it gained the pejorative moniker “Dr. Google.” But times are changing, and many medical-information seekers are now using LLMs. Acco...",
          "simplifiedContent": "**Title: Can ChatGPT Be a Better Online Doctor Than Google?**\n\nFor the last 20 years, when people started feeling unwell, they often turned to Google to look up their symptoms. This became so common that people jokingly called it \"Dr. Google.\" But now, things are changing.\n\nInstead of just using Google, many people are turning to something called ChatGPT for health advice. ChatGPT is a kind of smart computer program that can understand and respond to questions in a very human-like way. It’s part of a new wave of technology that can chat with people and give them information.\n\nPeople are curious to see if ChatGPT can do a better job than Google when it comes to health questions. It can provide detailed answers and even explain things in a way that's easy to understand. However, it's important to remember that while ChatGPT can be helpful, it’s not a real doctor. It’s always best to see a healthcare professional for medical advice.\n\nAs more people use ChatGPT for health information, it could change how we learn about our health and make decisions about visiting the doctor.",

          "simplifiedContent": "**Title: New Tech Company Raises $100 Million to Compete with Amazon's Cloud Services**\n\nA company called Railway, based in San Francisco, just got a big financial boost. They raised $100 million to expand their business. Railway helps developers (people who create software and apps) work more easily with artificial intelligence (AI) by offering special cloud services.\n\nWhat's interesting is that Railway has already attracted two million developers without spending any money on advertising. This shows that many people are interested in what they offer.\n\nThe new funding will help Railway compete with big companies like Amazon's AWS, which is a giant in cloud services (places where data and applications are stored and accessed over the internet). As more and more businesses want to use AI to improve their products and services, they need better cloud solutions. Railway is trying to meet this demand by making it easier and faster for developers to use AI.\n\nFor everyday people, this means that more businesses will be able to use AI to create better apps and services, making our digital experiences smoother and more efficient.",

He believes that the industry’s current obsession with large language models is wrong-headed and will ultimately fail to solve many pressing problems.  Instead, he thinks we sh...",
          "simplifiedContent": "**Title: AI Expert Challenges Popular Tech Trends**\n\nYann LeCun, a well-known expert in artificial intelligence, has a different opinion from many people in the tech world. While lots of companies are excited about large language models (big computer programs that understand and create text), Yann thinks they aren't the best solution for many real-world problems.\n\nYann has won big awards for his work in AI, so his opinions carry weight. He believes that instead of focusing on these large language models, we should explore other approaches to solve important issues. According to him, these big programs might not be as useful as everyone thinks and could be a dead end for some challenges we face today.\n\nFor everyday people, this means that the technology we often hear about might not always be the best answer. Yann encourages looking for different methods that could lead to better and more effective solutions. His ideas remind us that in technology, it's important to keep questioning and exploring new possibilities.",

          "simplifiedContent": "**Title: cURL Stops Bug Bounties Due to AI Confusion**\n\ncURL, a tool used by many people to transfer data on the internet, has decided to stop its bug bounty program. A bug bounty is when a company pays people to find and report problems or \"bugs\" in their software. \n\nRecently, a lot of reports about supposed problems have been coming in, but many of them are not real issues. This is because AI (artificial intelligence) tools are being used to find these bugs. These AI tools often make mistakes, spotting problems that don't actually exist.\n\nThis has made things very stressful for the people who work on cURL. They have to spend a lot of time checking reports that turn out to be false. It's been hard on their mental health (how they feel emotionally).\n\nSo, to keep things manageable and less stressful, cURL has decided to stop the bug bounty program for now. This means they won't be paying people to find bugs until they can figure out a better way to handle the situation.\n\nFor everyday users, this means the cURL team can focus more on making sure the tool works well, rather than dealing with incorrect bug reports.",

          "simplifiedContent": "**Title: eBay Cracks Down on Unapproved Shopping Bots**\n\neBay, the popular online shopping site, is making changes to keep its platform safe and fair for everyone. Recently, there has been a rise in automated shopping tools, often called \"bots.\" These are computer programs that can quickly buy things online without human help. While some people use them to snag deals, they can also cause problems, like buying up all the stock of a popular item before regular shoppers have a chance.\n\nTo address this, eBay now requires any \"buy for me\" bots or chatbots (computer programs that chat with users) to get permission before they can shop on the site. This means these tools must follow eBay’s rules, ensuring they don’t give some buyers an unfair advantage or disrupt the shopping experience for others.\n\nFor everyday shoppers, this is good news. It means more items should be available to everyone, not just those using special software. eBay’s new policy aims to make online shopping fairer and more enjoyable for all its users.",
